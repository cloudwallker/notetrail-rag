# Third-party components

NoteTrail RAG's own source is licensed under MIT. Runtime dependencies retain their respective licenses; this license does not replace them.

The executable is a Spring Boot archive. Original dependency JARs are retained under `BOOT-INF/lib/`, including their upstream license and notice resources. The `licenses/` directory contains a generated inventory and copies of license/notice resources found in these JARs. Test dependencies and Lombok are not bundled.

Major components include Spring Boot / Spring Framework (Apache-2.0), Jackson (Apache-2.0), Apache Tomcat (Apache-2.0), H2 (MPL-2.0 or EPL-1.0), HikariCP (Apache-2.0), Hibernate Validator (Apache-2.0), SLF4J (MIT), and Logback (EPL-1.0 or LGPL-2.1).
